## A little intro...

Hey there! I'm Yash — a backend/AI engineer at Krutrim ⚙️🤖, with a Master's from IIT Kharagpur and a Bachelor's from CHARUSAT.

It all started with GTA, but the real mission began with those 11 letters on the console 🌍. Since then, I’ve been building everything from Mobile apps, Web apps to AI-powered backend systems, diving deep into frameworks like React, Flutter, and FastAPI, and recently playing with LLMs and a little bit of DevOps stuff. 🚀

Ex–Data Science intern @ NPCI 🧠 | Thesis in Machine Unlearning with GNNs 📚 | Builder, Blogger, ProductHunt lurker, and meme scroller 😄

> Let’s build something cool — or at least something that compiles.

⚡ **Fun fact:** Sometimes my code works on the first attempt 😎
